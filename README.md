# Bala Shankar Malladi
###### Mutton Biriyani
A hearty mutton biryani that will amaze your guests! Biryani is a dish that nobody can ever resist. Be it a dinner party or any celebratory occasion, **biryani seems to be an ideal main dish to serve along with a spicy salan or refreshing raita**.This is similar to the Chicken biryani in cooker. Most restaurants serve mutton biryani that is not dum cooked. **They usually cook rice and meat together** or sometimes the gravy is kept separate and biryani rice separate. They just mix and layer the gravy and biryani rice as and when they get orders.
